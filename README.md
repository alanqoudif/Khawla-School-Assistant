## Overview

This is an AI-powered admissions assistant for Khawla School that helps students with questions about the unified admissions process for higher education institutions in Oman. The assistant uses GPT-5 nano as the primary AI model with fallback options.

## Environment Setup

```env
# OpenAI API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

```

**Note:** Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

1. **gpt-5-nano** (Primary model)
